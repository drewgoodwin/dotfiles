My personal neovim config.

- If you want to use Powershell on Windows as your default terminal update 
- If no native grep is available, install ripgrep: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
- When installing treesitter on Windows you may need to install mingw in order to get a compatible C compiler: https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/14oozmu/neovim_cant_find_c_compiler/
